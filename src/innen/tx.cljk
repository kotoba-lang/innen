  "Datomic / DataScript projection of an 因縁 record.

   One attribute table (`attributes`) generates three things, so the shapes can
   never drift apart:

     * `datomic-schema`    -- `[{:db/ident ... :db/valueType ...} ...]`, transactable
                              against Datomic / kotobase directly.
     * `datascript-schema` -- the `{attr {:db/valueType ...}}` map DataScript wants
                              (only the attrs that actually need declaring).
     * `->tx` / `->flat-tx` -- entity maps for the two consumers.

   Two projections, on purpose:

   `->tx` is the RELATIONAL one: an edge is an entity whose `:innen.edge/from`
   and `:innen.edge/to` are `:db.type/ref` values expressed as lookup refs
   (`[:innen.node/id :node/x]`), so Datalog can join through an edge to both
   endpoints' attributes in one query. `:innen.node/id` is
   `:db.unique/identity`, which is what makes those lookup refs resolvable and
   makes re-transacting the same corpus upsert instead of duplicate.

   `->flat-tx` is the FLAT one, for `com-junkawasaki/root`'s unified query plane
   (`manifest/edn-query.cljs`, ADR-2607252000): that loader reads vectors of
   plain maps, converts keyword attrs to bare strings, and has no notion of
   refs -- so there, an edge's endpoints stay keyword ids and nested maps are
   flattened to scalars. Same facts, no refs to resolve.

   Interval handling is the same in both, and it matters: `:innen.edge/valid` is
   a nested map, which neither Datomic nor the flat plane can store as a value,
   so it is flattened to `-from` / `-to` strings PLUS `-from-key` / `-to-key`
   integers from `innen.time`. The integer keys exist because ISO date strings
   only sort correctly for CE dates -- `\"-0221\"` sorts before everything as a
   string -- and a record covering human history has to be able to ask
   `[(< ?k 0)]` for 'before the common era' and have it be true."
