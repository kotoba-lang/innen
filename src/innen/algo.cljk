  "Pure algorithms over an 因縁 dependency graph.

   All traversal here is ITERATIVE, not recursive: a dependency record over
   human history has long chains (a 2026 fab depends on a 19th-century mining
   concession through a dozen intermediaries) and ClojureScript stacks are
   shallow. Nothing here mutates the graph; every function takes a graph from
   `innen.core` and returns plain data.

   The load-bearing semantic decision is in `cascade`, and it is deliberately
   conservative:

     * a `:required` dependency that fails, fails its dependent;
     * `:substitutable` dependencies of the same kind fail their dependent only
       when ALL of them have failed (that is what substitutable means);
     * `:incidental` edges never propagate failure.

   That means `criticality` UNDER-states fragility whenever the record is
   incomplete -- a node with no recorded dependents scores 0 not because it is
   unimportant but because nothing has been ingested about it yet. Every
   returned score therefore carries `:innen/basis`, naming what it was computed
   from, so a small number is never mistaken for a measured absence of risk."
