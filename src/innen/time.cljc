  "Historical time for a dependency record that spans human history.

   Dates here are ISO-8601 strings that MAY be partial and MAY be BCE:
   `\"1600\"`, `\"1600-12\"`, `\"1600-12-31\"`, `\"-0221\"` (221 BCE, ISO-8601
   extended year form). Partial precision is a first-class fact, not a defect
   to be papered over -- \"the Dutch East India Company was chartered in 1602\"
   is a real, sourced statement, and inventing `1602-01-01` to make comparison
   easy would fabricate a day that no source states.

   Every date therefore carries a PRECISION and resolves to a closed
   [lower, upper] key interval rather than a single point:

     \"1602\"       -> [16020101 16021231]  precision :year
     \"1602-03\"    -> [16020301 16020331]  precision :month
     \"1602-03-20\" -> [16020320 16020320]  precision :day

   Comparison functions take the conservative side of that interval so that a
   coarse date is never silently treated as a specific day. `contains?` on a
   year-precision interval means \"somewhere in that year\", and callers that
   need day-level certainty can ask (`certain?`).

   The key encoding is `year * 10000 + month * 100 + day`, which is monotone
   for negative years too (-221 -> -2210000, and -0221-03 -> -2209699 > the
   year's own lower bound), so ordering works across the BCE/CE boundary
   without a separate branch. It is NOT a day count -- differences between
   keys are not durations, and this namespace deliberately offers no
   `duration` function rather than an almost-right one. Proleptic-Gregorian
   vs Julian calendar drift for pre-1582 dates is likewise NOT modelled: a
   pre-1582 date is stored exactly as its source states it, and
   `:innen.time/calendar` records which calendar the source used when the
   source says so."
