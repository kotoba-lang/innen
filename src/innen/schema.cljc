  "因縁 (innen) -- the admissibility contract for a dependency record.

   A dependency graph over human history is only worth querying if every edge
   in it can be traced to something a human can check. This namespace defines
   what a node is, what an edge is, and -- the part that actually matters --
   what makes an edge ADMISSIBLE. `problems` is fail-closed: an edge with no
   source, an unknown edge kind, or an interval whose end precedes its start is
   an `:error`, not a warning, and `innen.core/graph` refuses to build a graph
   containing one unless explicitly asked to keep going.

   The reason for the strictness: a dependency claim about history (\"X existed
   because Y funded it\") is exactly the kind of statement a language model
   will happily produce from plausibility alone. The schema makes the
   unsourced version unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged.

   Directionality is fixed and non-negotiable: an edge always reads
   `from` DEPENDS ON `to`. Causation follows the same convention (an event
   `from` depends on its cause `to`), so traversal never has to ask which
   direction a given kind means."
